## Cars - Makes and Models

This is a quick React Demo App I through together over a couple of days.

You can see a test version of it at:

[https://cars-xg5.pages.dev/](https://cars-xg5.pages.dev/)

Once DNS updates, it'll be available at:

[https://cars.jeffclemmer.net/](https://cars.jeffclemmer.net/)

It's very basic. At the moment, it does not save any changes to the API. It does load JSON files from the API for car models.

This is essentially just a code test for myself to keep current in the realm of React ;-)
