This _was_ a quick React Demo App I through together over a couple of days. Now it's got a full backend using AWS API Gateway -> Lambda -> DynamoDB and configured using AWS SAM / CloudFormation.

It's pretty simple. It implements a simple car inventory system. There is one feature that isn't implemented. Editting. That's easily added though. Let me know if you'd like me to do that.

I built this to keep up with modern AWS and React development.

This app uses multiple cloud providers to do its thing.

AWS hosts the back end API and DB.

The front end is hosted on Cloudflare Pages.
